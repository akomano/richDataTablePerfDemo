1.) This demo is another example for richfaces dataTable component using Hibernate.
	Sorting and filtering is dedicated to Hibernate (database respectively) instead
	of do it by richfaces.

2.) How to get, compile and use this demo
	Checkout this demo from jboss.org repo:
	
	 $ svn co https://svn.devel.redhat.com/repos/jboss-qa/people/jjamrich/richDataTableHibernateDemo richDataTableDemo
	
	This demo is maven based project, so to build it simply use maven (developed using maven 2.1.0)
	 $ cd richDataTableDemo
	 $ mvn install # to clean project add clean goal, such as "mvn clean install"
	 
	Prepare your database (only in case you want to use MySQL instead of default configured HSQLDB)
	 This demo use MySQL. Create new DB named callsDB.
	 For table creation you can use script placed at src/main/sql/prepare-database.sql
	 Create user "sa", without password	 
	 Before run this demo, need to copy (or make sure if occurs here) 
  	 mysql-connector.jar into ${JBOSS_HOME}/server/${configuration}/lib and has set executable flag (on Linux).
  	 You should copy java-connector.jar from target directory:
  	 $ cp richDataTableDemo/target/richDataTableHibernateDemo/WEB-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.8.jar $JBOSS_HOME/server/${configuration}/lib/
  	 Change settings in configuration: uncomment MySQL related lines and comment hsqldb related lines in followind files:
  	  src/main/resources/conf/hibernate.cfg.xml
  	  src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/phoneCalls-ds.xml
  	  src/test/resources/cong/hibernate.cfg.xml
	 
	Deploy demo into your JBoss installation (or another server such as Tomcat)
	 $ cp target/*.war $JBOSS_HOME/server/${configuration}/deploy
	 
	Visit following URL in your favorit browser
	 http://localhost:8080/richDataTableHibernateDemo
	 
3.) use this demo as portlet on GateIn
	To create portlet from this demo, you should use jsf2portletConvertor tool.
	Tool is available at https://svn.devel.redhat.com/repos/jboss-qa/people/jjamrich/jsf2portletConvertor/
	This project is maven based, so simple checkout this project and run build.sh to compile project.
	convert.sh script provide convert functionality wrapper.
	Default usage is: $ ./convert.sh path_to_project_you_want_to_convert
	
	Note 1: this tool will change some config files (such as web.xml, faces-config.xml, or pom.xml if found).
	Because of this is better convert copy of your current project. But don't worry, tool make copies of all files he touch.
	
	Note 2: There is better to name project/copy of this project by shorter name, because of too long name for project
	should make problems for Portal to deploy portlet correctly. Project name (folder name) is used as name for new portlet.
	 

===========================================================
Database info:
 DB name: callsDB
 in src/main/sql is stored script named prepare-database.sql you should use to create your own DB
